<h1> Information about jQuery </h1>
jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.
<br> It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[3] As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.<br> Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.[4][5]

jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.[6] Later, this style has been enhanced with a deeper algorithm-data fusion in an heir of jQuery, the D3.js framework.

Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms.[7] Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio[8] for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC frameworks while Nokia has integrated it into the Web Run-Time widget development platform.<br>
jQuery, at its core, is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation library.
<br> The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click).
jQuery also provides a paradigm for event handling that goes beyond basic DOM element selection and manipulation. 
<br>The event assignment and the event callback function definition are done in a single step in a single location in the code. jQuery also aims to incorporate other highly used JavaScript functionality (e.g. fade ins and fade outs when hiding elements, animations by manipulating CSS properties).

<h2>Advantage of jQuery</h2>
The jQuery library simplifies a variety of programming operations, including:
Event handling—user actions such as a mouse click, form submission, or a keyboard keystroke—is reduced to a few lines of code that can be inserted just about anywhere in the JS logic of your application.
The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a browser interface that allows for the addition, deletion or update of HTML elements. jQuery offers multiple tools for doing so in methods like .replaceAll(), .remove(), .append().
The jQuery .ajax() method simplifies sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server without reloading the page. Other useful AJAX functions in the library include .getJSON(), .load(), and .serialize(), which can all be used with any platform and browser.
Developers can create dynamic effects throughout their application by calling on several of jQuery’s animation methods such as .hide() / .show(), .slideUp() / .slideDown, and .toggle(). If the built-in animations don’t do exactly what you need, you can use .animate() to create custom animations of many CSS properties.
<br><br><br>The principles of developing with jQuery are:

<br>Separation of JavaScript and HTML: The jQuery library provides simple syntax for adding event handlers to the DOM using JavaScript, rather than adding HTML event attributes to call JavaScript functions. Thus, it encourages developers to completely separate JavaScript code from HTML markup.
Brevity and clarity: jQuery promotes brevity and clarity with features like "chainable" functions and shorthand function names.
Elimination of cross-browser incompatibilities: The JavaScript engines of different browsers differ slightly so JavaScript code that works for one browser may not work for another. Like other JavaScript toolkits, jQuery handles all these cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface that works across different browsers.
Extensibility: New events, elements, and methods can be easily added and then reused as a plugin.<br><br>
